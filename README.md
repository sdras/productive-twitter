This version of twitter is very hard to override, so this extension is opinionated.

_Fair warning: I don't have a lot of time to maintain this and am not really taking feature requests- it's something I made in one sitting that I use, and people asked me to open source. Please feel free to enjoy it and fork it for your own tweaks! You can always ask for bug fixes and features, but I'm not likely to work on them unless I really want the change, too. All that said, please enjoy! 🍻_
